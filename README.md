# R for toxicology (statistical analysis) English version
Welcome to Jason's R for toxicology repository!

This repository contains contents ranging from the basics of R to
the statistical analysis which is normally used in toxicology.

I started studying R when I was in my second year of master's degree and
I had hard time studying it because I didn't have any background about R and statistics.
Thus, I can understand the difficulty of studying R and statistics.

I want beginners to study easily when they learn R programming and statistics which
can be applied to their study.

I hope you enjoy studying R and statistics in this repository!
